# README

Adopt, Don't Shop is a project for the Turing School of Software and Design, during the 2nd module. It is designed as an introductory project into Ruby on Rails. This website is hosted on Heroku at :https://adopt-dont-shop-jh.herokuapp.com/  

#### Project Description
We were individually tasked to build a website for pet adoption. The site accesses a database with tables for shelters and for pets. Each pet is associated with a shelter in a one-to-many relationship. The website allows you to create, edit, and delete a shelter. Once a shelter is created, you can add pets to it, as well as edit and delete them.

#### We had the following main learning goals:
   - Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag), buttons, and links
   - Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
   - Template a view in Rails using a templating language (eg, `erb`)
   - Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to implement CRUD
   - Create records with relationships to other records in a database
   - Test with RSpec--we've previously only used MiniTest
   - Use features such as pry, `save_and_open_page`, and Rails console to test and debug
