Adopt, Don't Shop is a project for the Turing School of Software and Design, during the 2nd module (week 7). It is designed as an introductory project into Ruby on Rails.  

#### We had the following main learning goals:
   - Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag), buttons, and links
   - Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
   - Template a view in Rails using a templating language (eg, `erb`)
   - Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to implement CRUD
   - Create records with relationships to other records in a database
   - Test with RSpec--we've previously only used MiniTest
   - Use features such as pry, `save_and_open_page`, and Rails console to test and debug

####
